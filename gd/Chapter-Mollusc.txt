Molluscs represent a phylum with approximately fifty thousand species that is marked by tremendous diversity from {some small clam] to the giant squid {scientific name}. Taxonomic classes include bivalves, scaphopods, gastropods, cephalopods, polyplacophorans, aplacophorans, and monoplacophorans. {something about evolutionary relation?} Despite this diversity there are some key characters of this group are an epithelial derived mantle that can secrete shell(s) or spicules, a foot that develops from body wall muscles, and a radula, a feeding structure that has is not present in bivalves. In this chapter we will focus on those molluscs that make up a significant component on the global aquaculture market which correspondingly possess genomic resources. Specifically we be examining genomic resources and how these resources our understanding of fundamental physiological process in bivalves and gastropods. In the remainder of this section we will provide biological and economic perspective on each group. 
Bivalves such as mussels, scallops, oysters and clams make up an important sector of of invertebrate aquaculture production         








        In considering how the role of genomics in mollusc aquaculture and how this field could improve aquaculture production of this group of organisms, it is important to consider how basic hatchery and production techniques. A majority of species that are farmed are broadcast spawners, meaning the gametes are commonly released into the water where external fertilization occurs. Larvae then develop in the water column and this process can take anywhere from (XX ) days as in XXXXX to (XXX) days which is common in xxxx. The length of time is going to be dependent on environmental conditions. During this larval period molluscs go through metamorphosis with involves a complete revision of the organ systems and body plan. In gastropods, such abalone, larvae undergo a process known as torsion when a 180 degree twisting of the nervous system and digestive system.

        There are a handful of publicly available draft genomes and numerous transcriptomes from molluscs. With respect to mollusc that constitute a significant economic impact the in global aquaculture production, the Pacific oyster has some of the most genomic information associated. One of the first integrative resources for this species was the Sigenae online resource (citation) where publically available transcriptomic data such as expressed sequence tags (ESTs) were assemble into contigs and annotated. This resource is still available at the time of writing this chapter (link). This resourced greatly increased the rate of scientific discovery in the field of mollusc genomics including <> . A draft genome was published in 2012 for Crassostrea gigas (Zhang et al 2012; Fang et al 2012). This effort used a short-read sequencing and fosmid pooling strategy that resulted in an assembly with 559 Mb and a scaffold N50 size of 401 kb (Zhang et al 2012).  A total of 11969 scaffolds were assembled with more than 90% of the assembly covered by the longest 1670 scaffolds (Zhang et al). A total of 28,027 genes were predicted in this effort with 49 RNA-seq libraries from different developmental stages and different adult organs and 59 libraries sequenced from oysters subjected to various stressors (Zhang et al. 2012). Other general features described with the C. gigas genome include that 36% of the genome was repetitive sequence as well as evidence for active transposable elements. 
        These oyster genome datasets were subsequently incorporated into the EnsemblMetazoa (http://metazoa.ensembl.org/) where the assembly is continually annotated. Only 7658 of the scaffolds have been used in the Ensembl platform, corresponding to 26,101 coding genes. Data can be accessed in numerous manners via the EnsemblMetazoa including via FTP (http://metazoa.ensembl.org/info/website/ftp/index.html) or using Biomar (http://metazoa.ensembl.org/biomart/martview). EnzemblMetazoa provides novel genome features compared to the source data including coordinate information for non-coding RNA and sequence repeats. 
        A pearl oyster (Pinctada fuctata) draft genome has also been sequenced with represents approximately 1150 Mb and 23,257 complete gene models (Takeuchi et al 2012). Over 800,000 scaffolds were assembled 629 at least 100,000 bp in length. The draft genome assembly and predicted gene products are available at http://marinegenomics.oist.jp/genomes/downloads?project_id=20.

3. Functional and applied aspects[d] (using transcriptomics, proteomics) within: 


        Much of what we have learned with regard to genome activity (gene and protein expression) in aquacultured molluscs has centered around fundamental physiological processes that are critical for improving aquaculture production. In this section we will address key aspects of biology with first reviewing how genomic approaches have improved our fundamental understanding, followed by direct comparison of the genomic underpinnings of beneficial traits. Note that here we will be focusing primarily on the expressed part of the genome and not as much on genetic approaches, those that target DNA variation and manipulation. For more information on genetic approaches there are several great reviews available (eg reference reference reference).
