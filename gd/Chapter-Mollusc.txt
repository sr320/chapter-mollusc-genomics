Molluscs represent a phylum with approximately fifty thousand species that is marked by tremendous diversity from {some small clam] to the giant squid {scientific name}. Taxonomic classes include bivalves, scaphopods, gastropods, cephalopods, polyplacophorans, aplacophorans, and monoplacophorans. {something about evolutionary relation?} Despite this diversity there are some key characters of this group are an epithelial derived mantle that can secrete shell(s) or spicules, a foot that develops from body wall muscles, and a radula, a feeding structure that has is not present in bivalves. In this chapter we will focus on those molluscs that make up a significant component on the global aquaculture market which correspondingly possess genomic resources. Specifically we be examining genomic resources and how these resources our understanding of fundamental physiological process in bivalves, cephalopods, and gastropods. In the remainder of this section we will provide biological and economic perspective on each group. 
Bivalves 


US two-thirds of marine aquaculture is molluscan shellfish such as oysters, clams, and mussels.
