Molluscs represent a phylum with approximately fifty thousand species that is marked by tremendous diversity from {some small clam] to the giant squid {scientific name}. Taxonomic classes include bivalves, scaphopods, gastropods, cephalopods, polyplacophorans, aplacophorans, and monoplacophorans. {something about evolutionary relation?} Despite this diversity, key characters of this group are an epithelial derived mantle that can secrete shell(s) or spicules, a foot that develops from body wall muscles, and a radula, a feeding structure that has is not present in bivalves. In this chapter we will focus on those molluscs that make up a significant component on the global aquaculture market. Molluscan aquaculture contributes a significant proportion of global aquaculture with 15 million tonnes produced in 2012 (Food And Agriculture Organization Of ...).  Specifically, we be characterizing genomic resources and describing how these resources are increasing our understanding of fundamental physiological processes. 
        In considering the role of genomics in molluscan aquaculture and how this field could improve aquaculture production of this group of organisms, it is important to consider the basic hatchery and production techniques. First one must consider the general life history. A majority of species that are farmed are broadcast spawners, meaning the gametes are commonly released into the water where external fertilization occurs. This is the case for most bivalves including mussels, scallops, oysters, and clam as well as for gastropods such as abalone. Cephalopods such as octopus are an emerging aquacultured group (Vidal et al. 2014) are quite different in this respect as internal fertilization is accomplished with a copulatory organ, often a modified arm referred to as a hectocotylus. While there are no known hermaphroditic cephalopod species (Pechenik 2010), many of the other cultured species are, including examples of protandric hermaphrodites (oysters, ie Crassostrea), simultaneous hermaphrodites (scallops, ie Argopecten), and rhythmical consecutive hermaphrodites (oysters ie Ostrea). 
Larvae that then develop from external fertilization are consequently free-living, and remain in the water on the order of days to weeks where they undergo a metamorphosis. The length of time is going to be dependent on the taxa as well as environmental conditions. During this larval period molluscs development from an embryo to a trochophore. A velum soon appears, which is a ciliated organ go through metamorphosis with involves a complete revision of the organ systems and body plan. In gastropods, such abalone, larvae undergo a process known as torsion when a 180 degree twisting of the nervous system and digestive system.  Once metamorphosis is complete the body plan is more similar to that of the adult form and the larvae will settle out of the water column where the might attach to a substrate (eg mussels and oysters) or have limited locomotory capabilities (eg abalone, clams, and scallops). The primary diet consist of plankton (bivalves) and macroalgae (gastropods). 


Mollusc aquaculture is different from most finfish aquaculture in that most adults are commonly place back into open water with intensive culture practices focusing on larval rearing. Often the culture process will start with the “conditioning” of broodstock with the feeding of nutrient rich microalgae usually grown on premises. It is worth pointing out that a significant portion of mollusc aquaculture is in fact algae culture. Once selected broodstock are reproductively mature, spawning and fertilization is initiated by either manipulating environmental conditions (ie temperature, food availability) or in some cases gametes are harvested and controlled crosses carried out. In some instances juveniles that have recently metamorphosed and settled, referred to as seed, are collected from the wild.  As embryos develop larvae are grown up through metamorphosis until the juveniles are of sufficient size to move out of the hatchery to either a nursery setting of open water to take advantage of the natural food supply. Adult culture technology varies and includes rope culture, cages / bags, and “planting” in the sediment.

2. Genomes[b]: diversity, structure, organization 10 pages
        There are a handful of publicly available draft genomes and numerous transcriptomes from molluscs. With respect to mollusc that constitute a significant economic impact the in global aquaculture production, the Pacific oyster has some of the most genomic information associated. One of the first integrative resources for this species was the Sigenae online resource (citation) where publically available transcriptomic data such as expressed sequence tags (ESTs) were assemble into contigs and annotated. This resource is still available at the time of writing this chapter (link). This resourced greatly increased the rate of scientific discovery in the field of mollusc genomics including <> . A draft genome was published in 2012 for Crassostrea gigas (Zhang et al 2012; Fang et al 2012). This effort used a short-read sequencing and fosmid pooling strategy that resulted in an assembly with 559 Mb and a scaffold N50 size of 401 kb (Zhang et al 2012).  A total of 11969 scaffolds were assembled with more than 90% of the assembly covered by the longest 1670 scaffolds (Zhang et al)[c]. A total of 28,027 genes were predicted in this effort with 49 RNA-seq libraries from different developmental stages and different adult organs and 59 libraries sequenced from oysters subjected to various stressors (Zhang et al. 2012). Other general features described with the C. gigas genome include that 36% of the genome was repetitive sequence as well as evidence for active transposable elements. 
        These oyster genome datasets were subsequently incorporated into the EnsemblMetazoa (http://metazoa.ensembl.org/) where the assembly is continually annotated. Only 7658 of the scaffolds have been used in the Ensembl platform, corresponding to 26,101 coding genes. Data can be accessed in numerous manners via the EnsemblMetazoa including via FTP (http://metazoa.ensembl.org/info/website/ftp/index.html) or using Biomar (http://metazoa.ensembl.org/biomart/martview). EnzemblMetazoa provides novel genome features compared to the source data including coordinate information for non-coding RNA and sequence repeats

3. Functional and applied aspects[d] (using transcriptomics, proteomics) within: 


        Much of what we have learned with regard to genome activity (gene and protein expression) in aquacultured molluscs has centered around fundamental physiological processes that are critical for improving aquaculture production. In this section we will address key aspects of biology with first reviewing how genomic approaches have improved our fundamental understanding, followed by direct comparison of the genomic underpinnings of beneficial traits. Note that here we will be focusing primarily on the expressed part of the genome and not as much on genetic approaches, those that target DNA variation and manipulation. For more information on genetic approaches there are several great reviews available (eg reference reference reference). 






Reproduction
        As indicated above the aquaculture production cycle starts with the reproductive maturation of broodstock which will lay the foundation for larval production and adult grow-out. From functional genomics perspective, there has been deserved attention towards understanding fundamental processes associated with reproductive maturation and spawning. 


While there have been numerous efforts targeting candidate gene function during reproduction, one of the first global approach to examining gametogenesis in an aquaculture relevant species was Dhielly and colleagues (2012) (Dheilly et al. 2012) study using a microarray platform in Crassostrea gigas. This oligonucleotide microarray was composed of 31,918 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) (Dheilly et al. 2011).  In comparing males and females Dhielly et al identified 77 genes that were sex specific[e] , which could have practical application in identifying broodstock. 


More recently there have been numerous studies that examine reproductive genes ( ie (Teaniniuraitemoana et al. 2015; Teaniniuraitemoana et al. 2014; de Sousa et al. 2014)

Metamorphosis
        Larval development and accompanying metamorphosis from a planktonic form into a sessile adult form involves a complete change in body plan. This time is one of the most critical in aquaculture production given the fragile larval state, nutritional requirements, and energy demands of metamorhosis  










Growth and Nutrition
        Like any agriculture product, growth is an important factor that considered in terms of reaching market size with minimum expenditure of resources. There are numerous aspects with regard to factors contributing to growth with functional genomic studies provide important insight insight into underlying mechanisms.
        In bivalves, particular Crassostrea gigas, growth heterosis is observed whereby hybrids often grow faster than respective parental lines (Pace et al. 2006).  In one of the earliest high-throughput sequencing efforts in bivalves, (Hedgecock et al. 2007) used massively parallel signature sequencing (MPSS) to examine gene expression patterns in two partially inbred and two hybrid larval populations. Previous work had shown that the hybrid oysters have higher feeding rates and feeding efficiencies than inbred oysters (Bayne et al. 1999; Pace et al. 2006) but nothing was known about underlying transcriptomic differences. (Hedgecock et al. 2007) found that approximately 1.5% genes control the phenotypes associated with oyster growth heterosis, and that protein metabolism was involved based gene annotation results. Later work (Meyer and Manahan 2010) also found protein metabolism drives growth variation in a study where using the same genetic families as (Hedgecock et al. 2007), examined 188 candidate genes. In this study, the majority of candidate genes were ribosomal proteins and the authors indicate that given the high metabolic cost of protein synthesis and degradation, inefficiencies in this process could certainly impact energy available for growth (Meyer and Manahan 2010).

        Whether molluscan larvae are being produced in a hatchery or adults are grown out in open water these organisms are susceptible to natural and anthropogenic alterations in environmental conditions ranging from ocean acidification to xenobiotics. Functional genomic analyses has provided important information how species respond to environmental stress.

4. Future directions[g][h] 5 pages


It is evident that molluscan aquaculture will be faced with challenges associated with an increasing human population including both feeding said population as well as persisting in a changing environment. Functional genomic research will play an important role on both of these fronts. 


Something on new technologies to produce more? broodstock selection, immunostimulants, GMO?


There is still a considerable amount fundamental biology that we do not fully understand regarding the ability of molluscs to adapt to changing environment.  There have been a considerable number of studies that have examined acute impacts of temperature gradients? (eg REFS) as well as ocean acidification (eg REFS) on molluscs. While generally these studies project a unfavorable impact on aquaculture, there are a limited number of studies that suggest some species will not be significantly impacted (maybe? REFS). In order to get a better idea of how commercially important species will respond to a changing environment, more attention should be paid to the capacity for an evolutionary response as opposed to a within generation response. From a practical perspective this refers to the possibility that on one hand an acute exposure to predicted future environmental conditions might result in significant mortality, while from an evolutionary perspective those individuals that survive could contribute to more robust broodstock. Functional genomic research efforts will play an central role in evaluating population responses, determining mechanisms, and providing information for modelling responses under different scenarios. Specifically this will include the linking genotypes and epigenotypes to phenotype (including interactive effects) and measuring the inherent genomic variation that occurs across generations. The latter is something that is not necessarily considered in the context of aquaculture production as the livestock counterparts (ie cattle, pigs, sheeps) have a considerably different life history strategies. Aquacultured molluscs can produce millions of offspring and whether an advantageous trait and/or a result of excessive gametogenesis, there evidence that genomic variation occurs at the nucleotide and transposable element level. Given the number of offspring produced at each spawning event and the propensity for variation, genomic tools that can quantify variation, selection, and mutations will be critical to understanding how to optimize aquaculture practices and predict yield.
